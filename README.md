# z88dk_breakout

This is an example skeleton for a simple breakout game done with z88dk + sp1 for the zx spectrum.
The are lots of space for improvements and corrections. You can freely use the code or ideas as you wish. I have commented most of it, you should be able to follow it easily.
If it helps you in any way, I'll be happy.

Check the make.bat to know how I have compiled it. You also have a TAP file in the deploy folder.
